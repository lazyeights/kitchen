# Chipotle Marinade

Makes enough for 2 lbs of meat.

### Procedure

* 30g `dried morita chipotle chiles`, seeds removed (or meco chipotle chiles)
* 1 cup `chicken stock`

Bring stock to boil and remove from heat. Soak chiles in stock for 5 minutes.

> Use the "morita" variety and not the "meco." The morita are dark purple, smaller, less smoky, and softer. The meco are light tan, larger, more smoky, and more stiff. Alternatively, use 2 tablespoons minced canned chipotle in adobo per pound of chicken. Increase the heat by removing fewer seeds

* 2 clove [[garlic]], crushed
* 30mL [[distilled white vinegar]]
* 60mL [[neutral oil
* 1 tsp [[ground cumin]]
* 1 tsp [[Mexican oregano]], crushed
* 1 tsp [[freshly ground black pepper]]
* 30g [[salt]]

> Adjust salt as needed to achieve 10% of marinade by weight.

Blend chiles, bouillon, and all remaining ingredients to a high powered blender or food processor and blend until very smooth, about 2 minutes.

Marinate meat refrigerated up to 24 hours.
